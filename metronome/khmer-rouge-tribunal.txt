The Legacy of the Khmer
Rouge Tribunal: Maintaining
the Status Quo of Cambodia’s
Legal and Judicial System
John Coughlan, Sana Ghouse and Richard Smith*
Abstract
The Cambodian judicial system is fraught with deficiencies. The Extraordinary
Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia – established to try the leaders of the Khmer
Rouge and those most responsible for the atrocities committed during the regime –
has been hailed as a model court from which to bolster domestic legal and judicial
reform. While the ECCC has made some steps towards providing a positive legacy
- enhancing the capacity of the judiciary, addressing fair trial rights and standards of
justice - in the absence of political will to address corruption and political
interference, this legacy is superficial at best.

Introduction
The Khmer Rouge had a devastating impact on the Cambodian judicial system. The regime
attempted to exterminate the country’s intellectuals and consequently, when the Khmer
Rouge fell in 1979, there were only ten qualified lawyers in the country.1 The justice system
was decimated and has been slow to recover. Since that time, deficiencies within the
Cambodian judicial system have been well documented.2 The Cambodian Center for Human
Rights (CCHR) for instance, which advocates for greater adherence to international judicial
standards by the Cambodian courts as part of its objective to enhance human rights
protection, has recorded a number of deficiencies in the domestic courts through its Trial
Monitoring Project.3 Although the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has pledged to
reform the courts,4 progress has been slow. Some of the more pressing concerns include the

fact that the judiciary are susceptible to political interference and fair trial rights are not
adequately protected.
When the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) was established in
2003 to try the leaders of the Khmer Rouge and those most responsible for the atrocities
committed during the regime, it was hailed as a model court for the domestic legal system
that could have a “positive long-term impact on national justice efforts.”5 This legacy, it was
said, could help bolster the rule of law in Cambodia and build the national judiciary’s
capacity.6 However, the ECCC has been beleaguered by several problems which threaten to
overshadow the potential it has to pass on a positive legacy to the domestic courts.
This article seeks to determine the likely impact of the ECCC on Cambodia’s judicial system,
focusing on fair trial rights and political interference. It is the reasoned opinion of the authors
that unless there is the political will for reform on the part of the RGC, the ECCC can only
have minimal impact on the domestic system. While the ECCC may positively impact fair
trial rights protection, it will do little to alleviate the more overarching problem of political
interference in Cambodian courts. The article makes this argument by first examining
problems endemic in the Cambodian legal system so as to underscore the deficiencies which
it is hoped the ECCC can alleviate to some degree. The article then considers what is meant
by legacy and what, if any, provision is made for it in the ECCC’s constituting documents.
Elements of the ECCC’s legacy that will affect the domestic judiciary positively are then
scrutinised, followed by an examination of the issues undermining the legitimacy of the
ECCC and its potential to effect positive change.
I. Cambodia’s Deficient Legal System
A system of patronage exists in Cambodia in which judges align themselves closely to
politicians with the power to influence judicial appointments from whom judges require
ongoing support to ensure career advancement.7 Patronage adversely affects the rule of law
as prosecutors and judges do not operate according to the law but at the whim of their
‘patron’.8 If judges do not act according to their patrons’ wishes, they risk displeasing them
and could easily find their careers stagnating or even lose their position.9 Cambodia also lacks
an established, experienced judiciary and suffers from resource and personnel shortages.10
These two issues underlay the entire legal system which suffers from serious deficiencies as a
result. Although the Council for Legal and Judicial Reform has implemented a strategy and

action plan for reform,11 many of these shortcomings persist. While issues pertaining to
impunity exist,12 they are beyond the scope of this article, which focuses on corruption,13
political interference and the judiciary’s poor record on protecting fair trial rights.
I.1 Judicial Independence and Political Interference
The principles of judicial independence and separation of powers are safeguarded by the
Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia (the Constitution) under Articles 128 and 51
respectively,14 as well as a plethora of international treaties ratified and incorporated into the
Cambodian legal system.15 These principles are instrumental in providing effective checks
and balances on the executive, legislature and judiciary to ensure that no single institution
can gain too much power. Unfortunately the judiciary in Cambodia is weak and highly
susceptible to political interference,16 particularly from the executive, which is dominated by
the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP).17
According to the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee, three laws fundamental for
judicial independence have still to be promulgated, namely the Law on the Status of Judges,
the Law on the Functioning and Organisation of the Court and the Law on the Amendment
to the Law on the Organisation and Functioning of the Supreme Council of Magistracy.18
Despite repeated assurances in 2004 that these laws would be prioritised and adopted, they
have yet to be promulgated, demonstrating the RGC’s weak commitment to legal and
judicial reform.19 Without these measures the executive, to ensure its political dominance,
can exert pressure on the judiciary. The President of the ECCC Trial Chamber Nil Nonn
acknowledges the lack of a meaningful separation of powers in Cambodia, stating that “judges
aren’t independent in Cambodia - [the government] threaten and put pressure on judges”.20
As a consequence of this pressure, the courts are frequently used by the RGC to silence

political opposition and criticism with civil and criminal charges regularly being filed against
individuals speaking out against the government.
I.2 Corruption
Corruption is a complex issue that is endemic in the judiciary and continues to plague the
courts. Although difficult to measure, in 201021 and 201122 Cambodia featured in the thirty
most corrupt countries in the world in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception
Index. In a survey conducted in Cambodia in 2006, the courts were considered the most
corrupt state institution.23 Although judicial salaries were increased from $20 a month to
between $325 and $625 a month in 2003,24 it has done nothing to hinder corruption in the
judicial system, which is so widespread that it can be considered the norm. Tim Sothy, Takeo
Provincial Court President in 2007, stated for instance that “[i]f a judge is a clever man, he
can find ways to make a lot of money.”25
The RGC has attempted to curb corrupt practices on a number of occasions. However, its
efforts have largely been superficial in nature and are considered to have been taken merely
to calm government criticism.26 In 2005 Prime Minister Hun Sen initiated an ‘iron fist’
campaign against corruption. At the height of the campaign three judges, two prosecutors
and two court clerks were convicted under the UNTAC Criminal Code for accepting bribes.
However, highlighting the insincere nature of the campaign, they were later acquitted at
retrial in 2006 and eight other judges that were suspended during the campaign were later
reappointed to judicial positions.27
I.3 Fair Trial Rights
Fair trial rights in Cambodia are protected by a number of legal instruments. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR) for instance are part of Cambodian law.28 In relation to domestic law the
Constitution guarantees a number of fair trial rights, including the right to be treated equally
before the law,29 the presumption of innocence30 and the right to an independent and
impartial hearing.31 There are also several laws and guidelines outlining procedures to be
followed in criminal cases such as the Code of Criminal Procedure32 and guidelines including

the Code of Ethics for Judges and Prosecutors which is binding for judges and prosecutors in
Cambodia.33
Despite these measures guaranteeing a certain level of protection for an accused’s fair trial
rights, the courts have often fallen below these standards. CCHR has documented a number
of problems of which the more disconcerting shall now be considered.34 Pre-trial detention
of accused is particularly high, being recorded in 83% of all trials monitored in 2011.35 More
worryingly, pre-trial detention exceeded statutory limits in 34 of the 1,316 trials
monitored.36 There are also concerns regarding the judiciary’s ability to recognise legitimate
grounds for placing individuals in pre-trial detention as most of those in such detention were
charged with misdemeanour offences rather than felony offences and of the courts reducing
final sentences of accused in acknowledgement of illegal pre-trial detention.37 Legal
representation is another area in which Cambodia falls short. Notwithstanding the fact that
the right to legal representation is a fundamental right protected under international38 and
Cambodian law,39 legal representation is only compulsory in cases involving minors or where
the accused is charged with a felony,40 there is no such requirement for misdemeanour
offences. Although an accused is required to have legal representation in felony trials, in
2011 only 62% of the accused monitored had legal representation. In relation to
misdemeanour cases, only 60% had legal representation.41 These figures raise serious
questions relating to the equality of arms principle- how can such individuals adequately
defend themselves if legal counsel is not available to them throughout the trial process?
In Cambodia questions about the ability to be tried by an independent and impartial judiciary
are prevalent. The right to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal is so
fundamental that the UN Human Rights Committee has stated that it “is an absolute right
that may suffer no exception.”42 An issue of concern from monitoring has been the frequency
in which CCHR trial monitors observe a prosecutor or another lawyer entering the judge’s
deliberation room immediately after the ending of a hearing and prior to the judge reaching a
verdict.43 In 2009 in 16% of all trials monitored, another party appeared to speak to the
judge during deliberation.44 While the number of instances where another party has appeared
to speak to the judge during deliberation has significantly reduced since 2009, any such

instances are disturbing and further undermine the public’s confidence in the judiciary and
cement the perception that judges are open to outside influence.45
II. Legacy and the ECCC
Internationalised courts, like the ECCC, are only temporary in nature, they have specific
mandates and once this is completed their lifecycle ends. Unlike other internationalised
courts, the ECCC is a true hybrid court because it is framed within the courts of Cambodia
thus placing itself directly within the national legal system and making the question of how
such a court can improve the legal system within which it operates all the more pertinent.
This is important as, although their primary function is bringing those responsible for
international crimes to justice, internationalised courts have the potential to impart a lasting
positive effect in their host country. In this regard, the United Nations Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has described legacy as a hybrid court’s capacity
to bolster “the rule of law in a particular society, by conducting effective trials to contribute
to ending impunity, while also strengthening domestic judicial capacity.”46
Proffered as a model court, the ECCC is advantageously placed to strengthen the rule of law
in Cambodia. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has stated that the ECCC should
have “considerable legacy value, inasmuch as it will result in the transfer of skills and knowhow to Cambodian court personnel.”47 It can improve the domestic judiciary’s understanding
of international standards as well as provide them with experience in conducting trials
according to international principles. It can also provide best practices to the domestic
judiciary in areas such as fair trial rights protection and court administration which can then
be applied in a domestic context.48 In broader terms, it can demonstrate to the public that
those that have committed crimes, even mass atrocities, can successfully be held accountable
for their actions.49 The ECCC can also have an important demonstration effect in that it can
foster a cultural shift in how the domestic courts are perceived. As it aspires to the highest
standards of independence, impartiality, due process and human rights norms, the ECCC can
demonstrate the supremacy of law and the ability of a court to operate free from political
interference.50 In this way, the ECCC can raise standards within the Cambodian judiciary and
promote greater public confidence in the legal system to deal with human rights violations
and resolve future conflicts.51
The extent to which legacy issues should be outlined in a court’s constituting document is a
matter of some controversy.52 The Law on the Establishment of the Extraordinary Chambers

For example, some contend that a hybrid court should concentrate on a core mandate of ending
impunity, each legacy being a matter for design and implementation, while others hold it is difficult to
build political support for legacy without a specific mandate. See OHCHR, supra note 46 pp. 7-8.

in the Courts of Cambodia53 and the Agreement between the United Nations and the RGC
concerning the Prosecution under Cambodian Law of Crimes Committed during the Period
of Democratic Kampuchea54 have followed the example of constituting documents for
previous international tribunals in that there is no explicit mention of legacy in either
document.55 Similarly, there are no specific provisions concerning legacy in the Internal Rules
of the ECCC, although it does provide for training for defence lawyers.56 While some assert
that a court’s legacy can be sustainable even if it is not explicitly mandated, others contend
that specific provisions relating to legacy are required in order to ensure that there is the
necessary political support vital for a court’s legacy to have a lasting impact.57 The OHCHR
holds that measures outlining legacy are preferable because “international experience
illustrates that the potential impact is much greater if legacy is an integral part of policy
planning from the conception of a hybrid court.”58
Despite this, according to the Atlas Project, pressures of time relating to the aging and
progressively infirm accused and shortfalls in the ECCC’s budget have brought legacy issues
to the fore.59 Legacy at the ECCC is an expansive concept, as defined by the Atlas Project:
[i]t spans and impacts on the judicial system, on the development of
internationalised justice systems internationally, of personal, political and
institutional relationships within the elite of Cambodia’s society, relationships
between many different groups within Cambodian society, between generations,
between people on different sides of the war in the 80s and 90s. It has to do with
what’s taught in Cambodian schools; what will be done with all of the records; the
extent to which victims feel that they have any closure from the process and many
60
other categories.

A lot of what the Atlas Project defines as legacy activities are in fact being undertaken by
NGOs based in Cambodia rather than the ECCC itself. The focus of this article is rather on
the activities of the ECCC, specifically in building a positive legacy for the Cambodian legal
and judicial system. The ECCC has instituted several initiatives in relation to its legacy. The
Department of Administration of the ECCC for instance has established a Legacy Advisory
Group to discuss matters relating to legacy and a Legacy Secretariat to take steps based on
these discussions.61 The Defence Support Section (DSS) has also been quite active in this
area.62 Furthermore, there is great potential for legacy benefits to transfer organically to the
Cambodian courts. These issues shall be discussed further in the next section.

III. The ECCC: Positive practices for positive change
The ECCC faces great challenges in providing a positive legacy for Cambodia. It must
maintain its legitimacy and impress upon the domestic judiciary the importance of
international standards of law while simultaneously building the capacity of the judiciary. It
must also attempt to alleviate the difficulties embedded in the system, such as political
interference and the courts’ poor human rights record. Although these challenges seem
insurmountable, the ECCC has made inroads into fulfilling these objectives. While NGOs
have been prolific in this area, undertaking ambitious outreach and capacity building
programmes, only legacy elements directly provided by, and in collaboration with, the
ECCC itself are considered below.63 Similarly, although outreach programmes are an
important facet of hybrid courts,64 focus here shall be given to ECCC activities that may
bolster Cambodian courts and judicial system specifically.
III.1 Fair Trial Rights
The manner in which the Trial Chamber has dealt with certain fair trial rights has the
potential to leave an important legacy for the Cambodian justice system. Judgments and the
constituting documents of the ECCC can help develop Cambodian jurisprudence and set an
example for better human rights protection. They may provide greater protection for certain
rights, which the Cambodian judiciary can learn from. The right to silence for instance is
protected under the Internal Rules.65 Although the right against self-incrimination is
incorporated into Cambodian law66 through the ICCPR67 and while the use of evidence
obtained through coercive means at trial in domestic courts is prohibited,68 the right to
silence is not explicitly protected under Cambodian law. As highlighted in CCHR trial
monitoring, the use of confessions as evidence in court is very common and there have been
instances at trial where the accused may have suffered either physical or emotional abuse at
the hands of authorities.69 By explicitly listing the right to silence as a right afforded to the
accused, the ECCC acknowledges its importance. This could create the impetus in
Cambodian law to provide greater protection for this right.
The importance of ensuring that an accused’s rights are safeguarded at the ECCC has brought
the role of the defence to the fore and the mandatory nature of the right to legal
representation. Under Article 13 of the Agreement70 and Article 35 of the Law on the
ECCC71 an accused has the right to legal representation of his or her own choice. Under the
Internal Rules, where one cannot afford legal representation and does not want to selfrepresent, he or she has the right to choose freely from the list compiled by the DSS and the
Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia (BAKC).72 Similar rights are provided for civil
parties.73 As considered above, legal representation in Cambodian courts, while mandatory
for felony cases, is not required for misdemeanour or petty crime proceedings. Furthermore,

free legal aid in Cambodia is extremely limited and mostly provided by NGOs.74 By
acknowledging the inalienable nature of the right to legal representation, particularly the
right to choose one’s own legal team, and by extension free legal aid, the ECCC may lead to
a positive change in the culture of legal representation in Cambodia and provide the drive to
develop a more extensive free legal aid service.
The manner in which the Trial Chamber treated Kaing Guek Eav’s (Duch) excessive period
of pre-trial detention in Case 001 is particularly relevant as unlawful periods of pre-trial
detention in the Cambodian legal system have been reported.75 Much can be learned from
this judgment on how to properly redress unlawful periods of pre-trial detention as well as
taking into consideration time already served in detention pending and during the trial. The
Trial Chamber found that Duch was illegally detained by the Cambodian Military Court from
1999 until his transfer to the ECCC in 2007.76 In its ruling the Trial Chamber alluded to an
earlier decision where it found there was a “general lack of reasoning setting out the legal
basis for [detention]. Further, several laws on which the Military Court relied [were] applied
retroactively” in contravention of Cambodian and international law.77 The Trial Chamber
consequently found that Duch was entitled to a remedy for the violation of his rights arising
from his illegal detention, granting him a five-year reduction to his sentence.78 The Trial
Chamber stated that “[n]either the gravity of the crimes of which he was suspected nor the
constraints under which the Cambodian legal system was operating at the time can justify
these breaches of the [a]ccused’s rights.”79 The Trial Chamber also reduced Duch’s sentence
for time already served, reducing his 35-year prison sentence by a further 11 years.
Ieng Thirith’s fitness to stand trial proceedings are also of great importance as they outline
the elements necessary for an accused to be considered fit to stand trial. The Trial Chamber
applied the Strugar test established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia in determining Ieng Thirith’s fitness, or otherwise, to stand trial.80 The applicable
standard for this test is whether the accused can meaningfully participate, allowing “the
accused to exercise his fair trial rights to such a degree that he is able to participate effectively
in his trial and has an understanding of the essentials of the proceedings.”81 Two assessments
were conducted by a number of experts to determine Ieng Tirith’s ability to fulfil this test.82
Tests concerning Ieng Thirith’s cognitive function and her medical history led the experts to
conclude that she lacked sufficient understanding of trial proceedings, her cognitive function
was likely to fluctuate and measures undertaken to counter her condition were unlikely to
improve her capacity to understand trial proceedings. She was consequently not fit to stand
trial.83 The Trial Chamber, in concurring with the experts, stated that the “[t]rial and
continued detention of an [a]ccused who lacks capacity to understand proceedings against her

or to meaningfully participate in her own defence would not serve the interests of justice”.
After lengthy deliberation the Trial Chamber ordered Ieng Thirith’s unconditional release.84
The above two findings illustrate the lengths courts must go to in order to meet international
fair trials standards. They provide clear rationale for protecting an accused’s fair trial rights
regardless of the crimes alleged. Duch’s trial shows that everyone is entitled to remedies for
a violation of their rights. Fair trial rights are not conditional, they are a separate matter from
the guilt or innocence of an accused. Ieng Thirith’s fitness to stand trial proceedings highlight
that there can be no justice where one cannot adequately defend oneself. This proposition
not only encompasses an accused’s fitness to stand trial, but also for instance the necessity of
equality of arms between parties and trial by an independent and impartial tribunal.
Recent events have somewhat undermined these developments. The Supreme Court
Chamber reversed the five year remedy granted to Duch for his illegal detention, stating that
the Trial Chamber had misinterpreted international law in reasoning that Duch’s “rights
should be redressed by it even in the absence of violations attributable to the ECCC and in the
absence of abuse of process.”85 It is important to note the dissenting opinions of two
international judges, Agnieszka-Klonowiecka-Milart and Chandra Nihal Jayasinghe, who
disputed the premise that the tribunal did not have a connection to Duch’s imprisonment
given the position of the court vis-à-vis Cambodia’s national system.86 They stated that they
would have preferred to reduce the life sentence to 30 years in prison to reflect the
violations of his rights:
Our remedy ensures that [Duch’s] crimes are strongly condemned and forcefully
punished. It also ensures, however, that his sentence is consistent with
internationally recognized standards of fairness and that this court continues to
serve as a model for fair trials conducted with due respect for the rights of the
87
accused.

The Supreme Court Chamber also reversed the Trial Chamber’s decision on the
unconditional release of Ieng Thirith, ordering her to undergo treatment to improve her
condition so that she may become fit to stand trial.88 The Supreme Court Chamber reasoned
that the Trial Chamber did not give any direction as to how proceedings may be resumed,
“an outcome [that] is irreconcilable with the interests of justice [and] the strong public
interest to prosecute the [a]ccused.”89 Despite this, it is hoped the rationale behind the Trial
Chamber decisions will have a longstanding impact on how Cambodian courts treat fair trial
rights and positively affects perceptions of the role of the defence in ensuring that their
clients’ rights are respected as discussed in further detail below.

III.2 Capacity Building
Capacity building within the Cambodian judiciary is another principle benefit of the ECCC.
In a country where the legal profession was decimated and where there is a serious lack of
qualified and experienced legal personnel, the ECCC is providing much needed legal
training. The DSS, which is mandated to organise training for defence lawyers in cooperation
with the Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia (BACK),90 has been active in this area,
providing training to a range of legal personnel and students.91 Training for lawyers includes
courses on legal skills and international law92 which are provided to both national staff and
lawyers outside of the ECCC.93 There are also opportunities for on the job training, with
provision of in-office mentoring and seminars involving presentations and discussions
between visiting legal experts and ECCC defence teams.94 While there are opportunities for
staff training, the ECCC has been criticised, particularly during its infancy, for limited
interaction with the wider domestic legal system. It has been commented that judicial
appointments by the SCM to the ECCC have been the extent of its interaction.95 With regard
to law students, the DSS, in collaboration with the Cambodian Office of the OHCHR,
established the Fair Trial Rights Club consisting of eight seminars on fair trial rights. The
initiative aims to provide students with a greater understanding of fair trial rights and
encourage them to promote greater respect for such rights when they work in the
Cambodian legal system.96 Furthermore, the DSS organises presentations and seminars in
universities to further students’ understanding of human rights and the role of the defence.97
The Office of the Co Prosecutors (OCP) has also undertaken capacity building initiatives.
Staff of the OCP participate in annual four-day workshops on procedural and substantive
aspects of international criminal law. These workshops include senior prosecutors from
international tribunals as speakers. 98 The ECCC runs internship programmes in all of its
offices.99 Trainee judges from the Cambodian Royal Academy for the Judicial Professions are
also seconded to the OCP for short-term internships on a revolving basis.100 Unfortunately,
the concept of an internship is unfamiliar to many national students and staff. Consequently,
these positions are often not in demand and intern supervisors frequently do not provide
interns with relevant work.101
Capacity building is essential to improving not only the knowledge and experience of the
legal sector but also for developing professionalism in the industry and encouraging greater
adherence to human rights standards. It provides students and lawyers with a clearer
understanding of the requirements of the law. The knowledge gained from mock trials and
role-playing scenarios can easily be transferred to real court situations. By expounding the
essential nature of fair trial rights through capacity initiatives, the ECCC may also impress

upon Cambodian legal professionals and graduates a defence team’s vital role in representing
their clients at court.102 Ensuring that law students have access to training and capacitybuilding projects is of particular importance. Deputy Director of Administration, Knut
Rosandhaug, has stated for instance that law students “are the judicial reform. If [they] don’t
do it nobody will.”103 This is a key issue that has been taken into account by the ECCC: in
order to have the widest possible impact, tribunals must not only train legal professionals of
today but also those of tomorrow.
Notwithstanding these efforts, the ECCC has been criticised for not taking a sufficiently
active role in developing a legacy for Cambodian courts. Representatives of the OCP and the
Civil Party Lead Co Lawyers have stated that trial related work must be given priority due to
the limited availability of funds, resources and time created by the ailing health of the
accused.104 Establishing legacy initiatives are viewed as ancillary to this objective. Capacity
building and skills transfer can occur organically throughout the lifetime of the ECCC
without the need for legacy building activities. However, in order to ensure effective skill
transfer, it is preferable that such activities are undertaken.105
III.3 Case Management Work Practices
National and international staff work together closely at the ECCC, it is inevitable that such a
working environment results in a certain level of work practice and skill assimilation. One of
the most beneficial aspects of hybrid courts is that national staff are involved in every step of
legal proceedings, from claim submissions to investigations, charging suspects, trial
proceedings and appeals. As a result national staff are shown how to best conduct trials, what
practices are most effective and what is required to fulfil their respective roles. Skills that can
be acquired include court and case management, court preparation, trial advocacy and legal
document drafting. Judge Nil Nonn for example has commented on the “reasoning culture”
of international judges that he has observed, stating that Cambodian judges frequently do not
sufficiently explain their judgments.106 It is also possible that skills acquired during complex
international criminal trials involving genocide and crimes against humanity for instance are
transferred to comparatively complex domestic cases such as human trafficking trials.107
Document archiving is another area that has been given considerable attention and could be
quite beneficial to the domestic legal system. The ‘Virtual Tribunal’ was launched in July
2011 by the ECCC together with a number of other institutions as an online multimedia
library and archive for information related to the Khmer Rouge and ECCC proceedings
among other things.108 Similarly, the website of the ECCC itself publicises all court
documents. Both websites are invaluable as they grant the Cambodian judiciary access to
documents that can be used both to make arguments at court and as examples in drafting
legal documents. The Virtual Tribunal and the ECCC’s website are also excellent court
document repository models for the Cambodian legal system which has yet to establish one
even though it has been marked as a strategy objective since 2005.109 These websites

illustrate the importance of the right of access to information, the benefits of providing access
to court documents and how one might go about providing such access. They also encourage
better work practices for document filing generally.
There are certain perquisites necessary for maintaining an environment conducive to
effective work practice transfer. Firstly, good working relations must exist. Discord between
officials can create a situation in which international and national staff do not work in a
coordinated manner, adversely affecting an individual’s ability to learn new techniques and
practices. One ‘side’ of the national/international line may be unwilling to allow the other to
observe its workings. Secondly, integrated administrative structures should be established
over parallel frameworks as the latter can have an adverse impact on skill development.110
Parallel systems, as is in fact in place at the ECCC, create a divide between national and
international activities, requiring staff to answer to two different superiority hierarchies. An
integrated system ensures that both national and international staff work more closely
together. Thirdly, the conduct and functioning of the various offices of the ECCC must meet
the highest standards of professionalism and international law, as setting a bad example may
result in the assimilation of less desirous practices.
The extent to which the ECCC meets these criteria is somewhat questionable. As discussed
below, there have been several confrontations between the national and international coinvestigating judges and prosecutors concerning Cases 003 and 004 which have resulted in
the release of a number of hostile press statements by the judges and prosecutors directed at
their national or international counterpart.111 Such confrontations can create a caustic
atmosphere in which working conditions can be unbearable, let alone conducive to skill
development. Furthermore, the conduct of certain judges has not met international
standards, undermining the ECCC’s legitimacy and providing poor examples for national
staff. As considered below, doubts have been raised about the independence of a number of
judges and the investigation conducted by the Office of the Co-Investigating Judge (OCIJ) in
relation to Cases 003 and 004 have been heavily criticised.
IV. The Never Ending Cycle of Corruption and Political Interference –
Legacy’s Achilles Heel
The ECCC has been plagued by several problems since its inception which seriously
undermine the legitimacy of the Court and hinder its legacy’s potential impact,
overshadowing the ECCC’s efforts to end impunity and risking the possibility that the legacy
of the ECCC will be a negative one, which may actually impede the development of the
domestic legal system. Allegations of corruption112 and political interference in particular
have been so widespread as to send a message to the national judiciary that the ECCC is no
different than the Cambodian courts.
IV.1 Corruption
The ECCC has been unable to avoid the culture of corruption that, along with political
interference, is so entrenched in the domestic legal system. Serious allegations of kickbacks
from Cambodian staff to political leaders in exchange for their positions arose in 2007,

allegedly having to share their entire first salary and 20% and 30% of their subsequent salary
payments.113 An audit carried out by the UN Development Programme in 2007 on human
resources management and hiring procedures also found that of 29 staff investigated 18
individuals did not meet the minimum requirements specified in the vacancy
announcements. It also found that 28 positions were filled by appointment of the RGC
without following a competitive selection process. Four of the 28 individuals were found to
have been granted significant salary raises in 2006, though auditors could not determine the
reasoning behind the raises as they were denied access to the four individuals’ personnel
files.114
IV.2 Political Interference
IV.2.i Political Interference in Cases 002, 003 and 004
Allegations of political interference at the ECCC are frequently raised and observers
continue to criticise the ECCC and the UN for their inability to adequately deal with the
matter. Letters were prevented from reaching King Father Norodom Sihanouk inviting him
to testify at the ECCC in Case 002.115 Six former Khmer Rouge cadres, now high ranking
government officials, were also summoned by the OCIJ to give testimony in Case 002.
However, the six individuals never appeared as ordered.116 In October 2009 Khieu
Kanharith, Minister for Information, stated that they “could appear in court voluntarily, the
government’s position was that they should not give testimony.”117
Submissions were made to the Pre-Trial Chamber to investigate RGC comments on the
matter as a case of interference with the administration of justice. The Chamber decision was
split down national/international lines. The international judges in their dissenting opinion
found that,
[n]o reasonable trier of fact could have failed to consider that the above-mentioned
facts and their sequence constitute a reason to believe that one or more members
of the [RGC] may have knowingly and wilfully interfered with witnesses who may
118
give evidence before the Co-Investigating Judges.

Conversely, the national judges reasoned that the comments were not by their nature
intimidating, threatening or coercive. They contended that as Khieu Kanharith used the term
“should” and not “shall”, his comments did not have “the character of an absolute order”119
and could not be considered political interference.
Allegations of political interference were also raised in relation to Cases 003 and 004. In
December 2008, disagreements between the Co-Prosecutors regarding adding five additional
suspects for charging and judicial investigations led the International Co-Prosecutor to make

a submission to the Pre-Trial Chamber outlining the disagreement and stating his intention to
investigate the suspects. The decision was split down national/international lines, with the
national judges supporting the Cambodian prosecutor in stating that the case against the five
additional suspects could not go forward, and the international judges supporting the
International Prosecutor in finding no basis for preventing the case from moving forward.120
In the absence of the judges reaching either a unanimous or supermajority decision, it was
presumed that the prosecution could proceed according to Article 19 of the Law on the
ECCC,121 the International Co-Prosecutor submitted the suspects’ names for investigation.
The RGC has long made its opposition to these investigations vocal. In June 2010 for
example, Khieu Sopheak, a RGC Ministry of the Interior spokesman, stated that “[j]ust only
the five top leader[s] [are] to be tried. Not six. Just five.”122 Prime Minister Hun Sen told UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in October 2010 that the cases were “not allowed”.123
Similarly, the spokesman for the Council of Ministers, Phay Siphan, said in October 2011
that “[w]e will stand on our ground regarding the ECCC. There will be no case 003 or
004.”124
The investigation into Case 003 has led many to believe that the OCIJ is toeing the
government line on the case.125 Basic information relating to the investigation such as the
suspect name was kept confidential. It was only through leaked documents that their
identities came to light.126 The OCIJ failed to conduct interviews with suspects or visit
locations under investigation.127 The OCIJ also gave victims of the crimes outlined in Case
003 only 15 days to apply for civil party status despite the fact that information regarding the
crimes under investigation and suspects was still not released to the public.128 In addition,
OCIJ staff filled the case file with documents from Case 002 in order to give the impression
that the OCIJ had conducted a full investigation. 129 The conduct of the OCIJ has been
heavily criticised by civil society130 and five UN members of staff at the OCIJ resigned in
protest of the premature closure of investigations in April 2011.131

VOL 4:2

While the National Co-Prosecutor Chea Leang welcomed the closure of the case,132
International Co-Prosecutor Andrew Cayley appealed the decision and requested further
sites be investigated and a time extension for civil party applications.133 The OCIJ considered
the request invalid on a technicality stating that the International Co-Prosecutor acted
unilaterally in filing the request in contravention of the Internal Rules,134 although the
practice was previously accepted at the ECCC according to Cayley.135 Cayley appealed the
decision to the Pre-Trial Chamber, however it was unable to meet the required
supermajority vote necessary to overrule the OCIJ decision as it was divided along
national/international lines yet again.136 The international judges on the Pre-Trial Chamber,
Judges Lahuis and Downing, reiterated criticisms they expressed in a previous decision137
questioning the conduct of the OCIJ in Case 003 and found that the OCIJ had failed to
comply with several provisions of the Internal Rules during the investigation.138
These matters came to a head in October 2011 when International Co-Investigating Judge
Siegfried Blunk resigned from his position citing political interference as the primary reason
for his resignation.139 In response, the Council of Ministers stated that the government had
never interfered with the workings of the ECCC. Rather, Judge Blunk’s resignation was the
“culmination of a sustained campaign by international organisations alongside persistent
media interference [which] have exerted increasing pressure to discredit and undermine the
ECCC, attempting to force it to charge more suspects.”140
IV.2.ii Political Interference with Judicial Appointments
There were additional claims of political interference more recently in relation to the
appointment of the Reserve International Co-Investigating Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet
as the replacement for Judge Blunk. In February 2010 Judge Kasper-Ansermet was appointed
to the position of Reserve International Co-Investigating Judge by the SCM. Under Article
27 of the Law on the ECCC and Article 5 of the Agreement this reserve judge is mandated to
replace the International Co-Investigating Judge where the latter can no longer fill the
post.141 Despite this there was a string of communications between Prime Minister Hun Sen
and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon from October to December 2011 in relation to

Kasper-Ansermet’s appointment as Co-Investigating Judge. The letters highlight the RGC’s
level of involvement in matters that it legally should have nothing to do with. In a letter on 3
November Hun Sen suggested careful consideration of Judge Kasper-Ansermet regarding
“certain activities by Mr Kasper-Ansermet that have been brought to public attention.”142
The activities in question were posts by Judge Kasper-Ansermet on Twitter in which he
provided information relating to Case 003 suspects that was already in the public domain,
criticisms of Co-Investigating Judges You and Blunk as well as posting his intention to reopen
Case 003.143 On 13 January the SCM, which as noted above is heavily influenced by the
executive, refused to appoint Judge Kasper-Ansermet. It reasoned that in posting the
remarks on Twitter Judge Kasper-Ansermet violated provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, the Internal Rules and the Code of Judicial Ethics relating to the circulation of
confidentiality information and criticisms of fellow judicial officers.144 This is despite the fact
that the UN had already investigated these concerns and decided they were unfounded.145
The RGC and ECCC national staff have continuously contested Judge Kasper-Ansermet’s
authority to investigate Cases 003 and 004, particularly his national counterpart, Judge You
Bunleng. Faced with this opposition, Judge Kasper-Ansermet has recently tendered his
resignation with effect from 4 May 2012, citing a dysfunctional situation surrounding Cases
003 and 004 arising from Judge You’s active opposition to investigations into the cases.
Judge Kasper-Ansermet has also opened internal investigations into interference with the
administration of justice.146
The UN has been criticised for not properly dealing with the above allegations of political
interference. UN officials, while unafraid to call on parties to respect the independence and
integrity of the ECCC, have failed to adequately respond to the allegations.147 UN
participation and oversight has been essential to the legitimacy of the ECCC and the
appearance of independence and professionalism. Despite this it has taken no meaningful
action to investigate claims of political interference.148 The UN Secretary-General for Legal
Affairs Patricia O’Brien was dispatched to Cambodia to assess the situation after Judge
Blunk’s resignation. Although she urged the RGC to refrain from making statements
opposing Cases 003 and 004 and from interfering with the administration of justice, she did

noted that Ms O’Brien seemed to be more interested in the fallout of such a probe, rather

V. Leaving a Lasting Legacy: Superficial or Confirming the Status Quo?
The likely influence of the ECCC on the Cambodian judiciary is somewhat difficult to gauge
though it is perhaps fair to say that for the ordinary Cambodian spectator hoping that the
ECCC would be an exception to a judicial landscape marred with corruption and political
interference, such hopes have not actualised. Although it has been proffered as a model court
for the domestic legal system, expectations must be realistic when measuring the impact of
the ECCC’s legacy. The OHCHR for instance has stated that “it takes many years to
complete even basic legal training and that reforming dysfunctional judicial systems and
developing a culture based on the rule of law and respect for human rights are long-term
goals.”151 It must also be remembered that hybrid courts are directed interventions, with
limited time frames and due to limited resources, compelled to confine themselves to the
objective of conducting trials.152 Similarly, one must accept the fact that while the ECCC is a
UN-backed tribunal, it is still only one centralised court in a country that suffers from severe
deficiencies in the legal system. However, even with these considerations in mind, the legacy
of the ECCC is superficial at best with even positive developments being rolled back on.
Headway that was made in relation to certain fair trial rights has ultimately fallen to the
wayside, with the national judiciary not gaining any greater understanding of how to transfer
adherence to these rights to domestic legal proceedings.
Ultimately it seems that we cannot ignore the institutional constraints and absence of
political will for true legal and judicial reform which shape the contours of the justice system
in which the ECCC operates. Apart from the DSS’s mandate to train national lawyers in
collaboration with the BAKC, the ECCC’s legacy was not taken into account during the
drafting stages of the Agreement, the Law on the ECCC or the Internal Rules and as a result
contextual issues were not adequately considered. While certain sections of the ECCC have
made efforts to initiate certain projects and strategies, there is no overarching strategy for the
implementation of legacy initiatives.153 There has been no concerted effort to tackle the
entrenched flaws within the legal system. Training programmes run by the ECCC, while
numerous, are not up to the task of educating and training an entire legal system that is
sorely lacking in qualified, experienced personnel.154 The availability of resources for
domestic courts is another issue that must be considered. The Ministry of Justice has
approximately 1% of the ECCC’s budget to run Cambodia’s courts.155 Therefore, it is
difficult to conceive how ECCC practices such as computerised case management can be
replicated in the domestic system.156 Echoing these sentiments, National Co-Prosecutor
Chea has commented that while ECCC national staff members would like to apply what they

have learned to the domestic legal system, severe budgetary and human resource problems
would make it difficult.157
Political control and interference in the judicial system is by far the greatest challenge to any
positive legacy that the ECCC can push forward, one that in fact stymies the ECCC’s own
ability to administer due process. The judiciary are not sufficiently independent and too
ensconced in political machinations not to bow to political pressure when it is applied.
Where a case comes before the courts with political undertones, there will likely be no
change, an accused’s fair trial rights will still be violated so that proceedings come to the
desired result. In this regard it may be questionable to enhance the Cambodian judiciary’s
ability to manipulate the law where it is clearly under political control.158 Such endemic
problems will likely hamper the ECCC’s ability to foster change in the domestic judiciary.
These issues are too entrenched in the system for a ‘one off’ series of trials159 to do much in
the way of alleviating them. They have been embedded in the system for generations and it
will be many years before any substantial change will occur.
The inability of the ECCC to properly investigate the allegations made against it has further
consolidated the belief that political interference in legal institutions is the status quo in
Cambodia. If the UN is unable to surmount such allegations, it is also unable to surmount
perceptions that the ECCC is just another Cambodian court suffering from the same
difficulties faced by domestic institutions and will unlikely be able to contribute to the
development of the judiciary. For the credibility of the ECCC, these discrepancies and
allegations must be fully investigated and not swept under the rug. They go to the heart of
the ECCC’s legitimacy and dealing with them openly and effectively will be the only way
that the ECCC can provide a good model for the Cambodian courts.
The key criterion which is lacking in Cambodia is political will to introduce judicial and legal
reform. In order for a hybrid court to establish a meaningful legacy for any domestic
judiciary, to effect real reform, international and national interests must coincide.160
Unfortunately this is not the case in Cambodia. As indicated above, while Cambodia has a
rather progressive constitution and has adopted a number of international human rights
treaties and incorporated them into domestic law, it frequently does not apply these
instruments in practice. For years the RGC has promised to revolutionise the judicial system,
including reforming the SCM and providing for judicial independence. However, despite
repeated assurances from the government, the necessary legislation has yet to be
promulgated. In the reasoned opinion of the authors, a strong and independent judiciary free
of influence is simply not in the interest of the RGC.161 The development of a robust,
independent legal system dispensing justice in accordance with the rule of law would
diminish the RGC’s current grip on power, something that it is unwilling to accept.162 The
RGC prefers to maintain the judiciary as is, a tool to be used as it sees fit.
Consequently, any changes brought about as a result of the ECCC can only be superficial in
nature. They will not go to the core of the flaws associated with the legal system in

Cambodia as any such reform would not be permitted to take root,163 fundamental flaws in
the Cambodian legal system will not be addressed. Although the ECCC may influence
individual judges to respect fair trial rights and adhere to justice standards, it will be unable
to foster a culture of supremacy of law which requires the political will to bring about the
structural change necessary to establish a truly independent legal system.164 Any
improvements in trial proceedings regarding fair trial rights protection, while welcome, will
be overshadowed by the fact that the courts themselves still lack independence.
Conclusion
The ECCC has undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at enhancing the capacity of the
national judiciary, adherence to fair trial rights and standards of justice. However, there is no
overarching framework guiding these programmes. Inroads made by the ECCC to improve
the legal system to date and its ability to foster change are hindered by a number of factors
including political interference. While there is promise that reform may occur, particularly
in relation to the protection of fair trial rights, Cambodia lacks the central component
necessary to ensure the ECCC can have a lasting impact- the political will of the RGC. As
such, any attempts to reform overarching deficiencies in the legal system, i.e. the system of
patronage and political interference, will be unable to take root as it is not in the RGC’s
interest to establish a truly independent judiciary. There is however some hope that the
ECCC can foster public demand for legal reform. Rather than expecting the ECCC to bring
about such reform by itself, the ECCC should be considered as a means of planting the seed
of legal reform, encompassing the separation of powers, greater adherence to fair trial rights
and the rule of law, in the public consciousness. Only through the Cambodian people can
real change come.
