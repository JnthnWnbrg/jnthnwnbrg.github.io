The Art of Forfeiting: Culture and Computation of Igo/Baduk/Weiqi


Thesis: The Art of Resignation (forfeiting) in Go can probably be used during Machine Learning training for Go and other games and it would also make the AI a more respectful junzi (Confucian gentleman) that would attract more pro players to play against the AI for practice.

Modified a Chinese web Go game to have a weak AI that takes capture of atari when the opportunity arises and can play continuously with itself to have a nice screensaver. zoeweinberg.github.io/nixBoard
