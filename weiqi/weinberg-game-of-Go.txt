The Art of Forfeiting: Culture and Computation of Igo/Baduk/Weiqi


Thesis: The Art of Resignation (forfeiting) in Go can probably be used during Machine Learning training for Go and other games and it would also make the AI a more respectful junzi (Confucian gentleman) that would attract more pro players to play against the AI for practice.

Modified a Chinese web Go game to have a weak AI that takes capture of atari when the opportunity arises and can play continuously with itself to have a nice screensaver. zoeweinberg.github.io/nixBoard

So far, it does not implement scoring, which according to the rules of Go, would involve counting territory, which might be a little difficult, even for an insei/prodigy of Go (Source: Hikaru no Go, episode "No winning allowed"). A simple way to gauge scoring initially for this test program could be to merely count up how many stones of each color are on the board, which is part of scoring in some rulesets anyways (Source: Wikihow, Go scoring). In the end, a strong AI would still leave eyes (holes) in their groups/chains of stones to prevent them from being captured/eaten/wiped out. Go is similar to reality, because even though having dents in the population seems counterintuitive, according to Veritasium's video "This equation will change your perception on life", populations of living organisms swing from being overpopulated to underpopulated. Lacking social distancing during an epidemic loses the seige, even when Genghis Khan was on the outside. 
	This simple scoring technique would allow one to further modify the program and involve a simple Machine Learning algorithm like a genetic algorithm (evolution) that could not see what the opponent is doing but at least prioritize which moves it would want to make first, like a TASbot (Tool Assisted Speedrun). The first moves it would end up making after training would be the four square points, roughly. According to Hikaru no Go's ending Go lessons, playing close to the edge of the board helps because less stones are required to form territory; this is similar to the Art of War, which uses the least resources possible to win. It is also similar to the money-saving aspect of Mohism. 
	Whichever color lost the match would mutate its algorithm. So instead of playing tengen (center, source: Dwyrin's video "Dosaku vs. Tengen" about the 1600s match), the algorithm would prioritize one of the four points (or nearby points such as 2,3) first, and if that space was taken it might go to its next favorite spot, another of the four outside spots, such as 16,16. This queue of choices would be relatively easy to program and could help focus on the machine learning aspect, which would then enable testing of the Art of Forfeit. After testing simple adversarial machine learning between two agents, the program should then be further edited to include four agents. To make things simple, agents would not switch color even though the game isn't perfectly fair without a perfect komi score to compensate white going 2nd. This is because white and black have to play differently (though komi changes the styles). White has to be passive, which is actually the opposite of its aggressive Yang symbol, according to Weiqi Wonders. 
	The two groups of agents would have the same amount of playing time to train, though they would be able to play as many matches as they want given the time they have. So far, the program cannot yet resign, though that would be esomewhat easy to implement, probably only an hour of coding at most for a Computer Science minor. The program can, however, pass. Passing a move means to refuse to make a move, though the word refuse sounds more impolite than it is in this game. Passing usually happens at the endgame when not much can be done to change the outcome. When both players pass consecutively, the game is over and the board is scored. Passing usually occurs when the scores are close to a tie, but an easy way to implement resignation would be to either pass or to forfeit after mthe number of prisoners is very unequal. In a match with a human, though, passing when about to lose by a lot would probably be impolite unless the player was a novice who could not yet count territory well. 
	One set of agents would play only until the endgame and not make unnecessary moves. The other set would play until the board is completely filled with stones and one-space true eyes that cannot be played on because of the rule against suicide. The javascript program would switch between the two games like an expert sensei playing multiple games against many opponents at once but in this case only observing and proctoring multiple games at once. Actually, using time to limit the training time might not even be necessary in the preliminary stages of the program editing; one could just count the total number of moves made in each game and add them up, for example, a 200 move game where the scores were closeplus a 100 move game where the scores were more unequal, would add up to 300 moves played by the polite agents. The impolite agents would be allowed to play 300 moves as well, and would probably only complete one game. The impolite agentsght succeed to train themselves to be annoying (xiaoren) and be able to take advantage of the polite agents in the end but probably if the polite agents played with the impolite agents after training, the polite agents would win because they would reach the endgame with a lot more points impossible to come back from.
