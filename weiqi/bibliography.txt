Weiqi Wonders documentary directed by Marc L. Moskowitz

According to Weiqi Wonders, weiqi was prohibited for commoners at one point in ancient times.



Like a Go player in Weiqi Wonders says, "an injured but spared soldier returns to his home country and becomes a burden to his society." Likewise, soldiers returning home from World War 1 spread the Spanish Flu pandemic that killed more people than World War 1 and World War 2 combined (source: the Pandemic documentary on Netflix). Even if soldiers do not bring sickness, we do have many homeless veterans who have lost legs and many drunkards in San Francisco, like the weiqi player talked about. He explained how laying a small mine instead of a big mine wins the war in the end, which relates to weiqi and the Art of War.

One of the weiqi players in Weiqi Wonders also said that there is no such thing as a weiqi player who is a bad person.
