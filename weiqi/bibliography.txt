"Last but not least, weiqi allows a player to accept defeat and resign at any time, without having to count the amount of space each player has taken. Practically, players save time this way, so they can start another game."
also has many references to articles, like:

Which seems to refute Wikipedia's statement that Go is a zero-sum game. I think this source and others also describe the 4 arts as being weiqi, music (which the CCTV documentary describes as being specifically the guqin, as Prof. Kumiko Uyeda said about Confucius), shu (not the character for book)/calligraphy, and painting. In the capstone syllabus, I mistakenly wrote poetry instead of painting.

“An anecdote titled "Two Students Learn Weiqi" (二子学弈), collected in the ca. 300 BC philosophical book Mencius, revolves around Yi Qiu and his two disciples, whose attitudes were in stark contrast with one another.[3] The first student was easily distracted, whereas the other was focused and diligent in studying weiqi. Consequently, the former found no success whereas the latter excelled in the game. Mencius used this tale to expound that even a simple game like Weiqi demands one's full attention.[4] This is also the earliest known historical reference to weiqi, making Yi Qiu the first recorded weiqi player in history.[5][6][7]” Wikipedia Yi Qiu

Lee Se-dol went on to win a tournament after losing to AlphaGo (source: AlphaGo documentary) but later on retired and scheduled to play against another program with a 2 stone handicap. “Even if I become number one...” (source: duckduckgo search). However [spoiler], retiring does not necessarily mean quitting, as Hikaru no Go explains.

“In Asia, there is not as much stigma like there is in the West for becoming an expert/genius at the expense of letting the physical body deteriorate, like we see in The Theory of Everything.”



“Early writings depicted Weiqi as a waste of time, but eventually became included in the four noble things of gentry.”

“I remember the chill of the Go stones” -Fujiwara-no-Sai in Hikaru no Go. Go stones are indeed a little chilly. Boards are indeed made of wood. Placing stones on the intersections of the trenched lines probably makes them less likely to move around.

Go stones can literally be stones or bottle-caps (Hikaru No Go’s Go Go Igo live action videos) (or expensively made from large white seashells (source: Chinese weiqi documentary series of Go even in jail and also in religion)). A kifu is a record of a game on paper (Hikaru No Go). With these things in mind, Go can be played with just paper sheets and a pen. Although Go is “a very hard game” (librarian), there are less physical limitations and rules to learn than chess.

Expensive quality Go boards are made with kaya wood which is light colored and produces a sharp clack when a stone is placed. Fake kaya called shin-kaya is often made from imported spruce to Japan and has the same color but lacks the sound. There is also another type of wood for boards. (Hikaru no Go).

The Japanese Robotics Innovations speaker who was a robotics patent decider particularly for toy robots and also video games, told me about the relation of AI to the game of shogi.

My favorite part of the talk was how he explained the need for robotics due to Japan’s aging population.

Hon’inbo Shusaku (surname) Torajiro (given name) died early in his 30s due to an epidemic. Shusaku invented Shusaku’s Diagonal, “a series of opening moves that remains popular in games without komi” (Go Go Igo).

There is also an app game called BadukPop which has powerups (Haylee’s World of Go).

Hikaru no Go has an episode “No winning allowed” in which the challenge is to play to a perfect draw without the opponent realizing what the pro is doing.

Sanitation in Go is important because in Go Salons, the stones need to be washed (Source, Hikaru no Go). Perhaps a reason that wooden Go boards have prevailed over plastic (besides in magnetic Go boards, probably) is because wooden cutting boards are supposedly more antibacterial than plastic cutting boards (source: https://www.rowandsons.co.uk/blog/myth-fact-antibacterial-properties-wood/ although this site sells wooden and plastic cutting boards, it references this article: https://www.johnboos.com/uploads/files/PDF/wood-vs-plastic-cutting-boards.pdf although this site also sells wooden cutting boards. Also, water in wooden cups or plastic bottles with bamboo chopsticks smells less stale than water in ceramic cups (without chopsticks) or plastic bottles without chopsticks).

Answer 2


Weiqi is often compared to war or the creation of starry galaxies (Hikaru no Go, Ernest Brown's The Glass Bead Game), but weiqi seems more like white blood cells consuming their enemies. The ease in which AlphaGo transitioned to folding proteins shows how realistic weiqi looks, especially on a molecular or cellular scale.

The art of resigning (The Treasure Chest Enigma book) could be used not only with human vs. AI matches but also during AI training with itself, as it may speed up the process (with the expense of reduced meticulousness). The Art of Resigning chapter says the main difference between pros and amateurs is that pros resign more often. This may be because pros are more able to see a match's fate (Sai in Hikaru-no-go) and also because resigning helps give players more training time to become pros. It is not quite clear from papers and README documentations as to whether AIs already implement resignation for training with itself. Looking at the code might be necessary. However, it is difficult even to simply program the rules of Go because capturing involves analyzing many links between stones. Quality Go game emulators are sometimes only commented with Chinese. A way to test the effectiveness of resigning could be to give at least 4 virtual players the same amount of time to play multiple games, with 2 players playing to resign and the other 2 players playing out the entire games without resigning.

A way to make Go more appealng to women might be to label it more like Candy Crush and focus more on the eating aspect of the game rather than the surrounding part.

Terms for move spacings in Go like the knight's move and the elephant's eye (hazama) probably come from Xiangqi (象棋, the Elephant Game, Chinese Chess) even though Go/Weiqi came first.

Painting of emperor Yao

^ There is an actual mountain named "Rotten Axe Handle (Lanka) Mountain"
^ There are 181 black stones, 180 white stones.
I guess white goes 2nd (plays Gote instead of Sente) because clamshells are harder to find than slate. Probably not, but an idea.



From my experience playing chess with inpatient players tired of moving pawns, the preset stones in the original Go in China before Qing dynasty might have been a way to save time. It also suggests to people around that the game is ready to play, and it is not a cutting board, and since the stones alternate, it is not just somebody sorting stones by color.

Byo-yomi, defined by Wikipedia as time-control in games. According to Hikaru No Go, time clocks were not used even as late as Shusaku in the 1900s.

Hon'inbo Shusaku Torajiro (given name, or was it the individual name he chose for himself?) died early in his 30s from an epidemic. He has a grave in Inno-shima (shima meaning island) in Hiroshima and also in Tokyo made by his students.


According to the film A Beautiful Mind, John Nash lost a game of Go and the bet was to do laundry for the semester. (Scene found in Youtube playlist of Go and the Art of War).
And playlist also has a Minecraft implementation of Go capturing rules.

"Mohist chess"/Othello/Reversi as fictionalized by Qin's Moon in the Mechanical City episodes. According to Wikipedia, Reversi was not invented until later. Mohism is also not directly linked to weiqi although often mentioned in the same webpages or articles. Mohism focuses on self-defense rather than the Art of War.
Playing without komi is another way to play, especially with Shuusaku's Diagonal (Go Go Igo). It encourages the original joseki (local skermishes shapes).

For the Hon'inbo competition, games are played over 2 days. A move is sealed hidden on paper at the end of day 1 so that the opponent does not get the night to think about it and react to it.

For my first implementation of making AI play Go, I would go easy on myself for programming and make the board even smaller than Tic-tac-toe, making it a 2 by 2 board. IF I cannot easily directly mesh an AI project with a Go project. Go boards traditionally have an odd number of lines to have a center point (Go GO Igo). In a 2 by 2 game, black would win without komi if it plays first (sente) and plays on the corner which it must and then white plays oHane (extension) adjacent to black. Black would then capture white and form 2 eyes. White must play on the diagonal to meet a draw or an endless game of recapturing.

Nigiri (choosing color stones) is in a way itself a game of rock-paper-scissors, though the end result is like a coin flip.


Nigiri is picking up a handful of stones and the opponent guesses whether the number is even or odd by placing one or two of his stones down.


It is somewhat philosophical (or arguably coincedental) that black plays first in Go but 2nd in Chess of Europe. Mohism prefers to stay in the darkness (Qin's Moon). I remember reading years back that Daoism also prefers yin/dark /soft over yang/light/hard. In a famous wuxia/fantasy movie about a fox-spirit lady, the male lead (spoiler) turns out to be a good guy partly because he wears black armor so that his comrades are not concerned by his blood. Even my parents watched that and my mother remembers it.

This is contrasted with the unfortunate terminology of Europe like blacklist and black magic which labels black as negative though Japanese also has a negative term like black company which was also referenced in the Korean Misaeng series.

But my paper should mainly focus on the art of resigning. In the post-AI NHK tournament where the female Kisei (title) won, the male player also resigned by placing one of his prisoners on the board. So the Alphago movie resignation is not just something that Lee Sedol does. 
Lee Sedol's autograph on the board he gave to Hassabis (the chess player and leader of AlphaGo) shows that his name Lee is the surname 李 which is also a Chinese character. According to the Alphago movie, Lee Sedol grew up on a farm believing that pizza grew on trees. To my surprise, Lee Sedol's game-changing God move 76 where he beat AlphaGo once was right after his smoke break. According to the web, addiction may be because nicotine temporarily increases mental function (although decreases it in the long term). I would also argue that another player who faced Alpha, Ke Jie, who later played Lee Sedol, with both of them using Kick moves like Alpha), also has a kind of addiction to prescription glasses, like me. Haylee from Haylee's World of Go also wore glasses even at a young age while her sister did not and her sister preferred to be more active.


I am not sure if it is listed in the credits or if Netflix skips the credits, but I think I recall the Japanese minor-key song in the Surrounding Game was Rokudan, played on the koto zither.


Minigame: 3 or 4 player Go with red or gold pieces (source: the controversial Chinese animation series Everlasting Firmament and also Surrounding Game).


Minigame: Doubles (pairs) Go where players cannot give each other hints and take turns playing as the same color. Source: Hikaru no Go. There is also a video from an NHK tournament of a Pairs game.

One of my favorite aspects of Hikaru no Go is the Heian period's clothing fashion of the noble's ghost Fujiwara-no-Sai. Sai wears a long sleeved shirt/tunic with two layers. The outside layer has a gap around the shoulders. Those gaps probably provide adequate ventilation for warm seasons like summer and Spring while the long sleeves provide warmth in the Autumn and Winter, maybe even in the snow like in the series. Sai also wears white shoes or thick socks that have a separate big toe. Years ago I remember reading on Wikipedia about construction workers in Japan wearing boots with separate big toes for extra dexterity/balance. The article was probably about toeshoes. I have tried wearing individual-toe-shoes and also toeshoes that group the pinky and 2nd smallest toe together, which is more convenient. Individual-toe-socks are a little tight and can affect the sizing of the shoes. I suppose the main reason I stopped wearing toeshoes was because I accidentally shrunk them in the dryer. However, I do wear Hatsune Miku style sleeves that are similar to Sai's outfit, but without the inner layer, though sometimes I also wear a thin inner layer as well. Hikaru himself sometimes wears a hoodie with short sleeves, which I do as well. The tank top hoodie is becoming more popular in SF now that it is Spring, but only a few months ago it was a style that I had only seen in anime and donghua (Chinese animation).


Probably another reason that Go boards are traditionally made of wood is that ceramic breaks easily and into shards. Go stones can be chipped (Source: Hikaru no Go, especially if they are glass I suppose, However, I think the small round shape of the stones would make them less likely to break than an entire glass board. There is an ancient painting shown in the Surrounding Game of a man in Samurai armor knocking over a Go board in anger. John Nash also knocked over a Go Board by accident after he lost and left in A Beautiful Mind and didn't even bother to pick up the stones either even though he lost the bet to do the laundry. "Ragequitting" is a term common in video gaming and controllers are somewhat delicate.


However, according to the "Survivor Bias" video by Veritasium, traditional buildings like the ones in Korea may look that way and have superior architecture perhaps just because they are the only buildings from the past that have survived this long. Therefore, perhaps Go boards were not all wood in the past, but only the wooden ones survived.


Wang Gu Xian Qiong (Everlasting Immortal Firmament) is the controversial donghua that references Go probably the most out of the 50 something donghua with English subtitles.

Game possibility tree


One of the four noble things was playing guqin (古琴). According to Prof. Kumiko Uyeda, Confucius hated the Se, the larger predecessor of the guzheng (古筝). If I had to guess why Confucius hated the Se, besides the typical skepticism of new technology and also the idea that the guzheng is from the ethnic minority rather than the Han majority, I would guess that it is because guzhengs are usually tuned to play a major pentatonic scale. Major scales are almost always used in national anthems, which can be thought of as war songs and prideful. The game of Go is indeed a war game, but it also focuses on accepting one's own loss, which national anthems rarely do. However, I do not think that Confucius would necessarily hate the newer instrument, the 扬琴 (yangqin), as it shares the same chracter qin for zither (though the guzheng is also a zither) and the character gu 古 in both guzheng and guqin simply means ancient and doesn't necessarily mean that they are more similar than a yangqin and guqin.
The yangqin is tuned with strings for all 12 chromatic notes, and the guqin icmalso makes it easy to play in a chromatic scale because the strings are unbridged and the pitch is controlled by pressing down on the strings with fingers. The yangqin can play both minor and major scales without being retuned, similar to a guqin. A guzheng (such as the one in the 25-string guzheng youtube song) could also be retuned to play all 7 European notes which includes both apentatonic major and minor scales. In a similar way that a Go board has many possibilities, a guqin also has infitely many notes going beyond the precision of 12 notes and could even play a 24 note key, though it would require close listening.

According to Hikaru no Go's Let's Play Go, the "the oldest title in Japan is Hon'inbo" not even Kisei, so therefore the Hon'inbo title must be even older than the Tale of Genji, 3000 year old book, and Go also existed in China before Japan.
