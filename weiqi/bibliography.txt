Alphago probably named after Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc, not like alpha male. 
There is also AlphaFold which will likely be folding proteins of Wuhan virus.

“An anecdote titled "Two Students Learn Weiqi" (二子学弈), collected in the ca. 300 BC philosophical book Mencius, revolves around Yi Qiu and his two disciples, whose attitudes were in stark contrast with one another.[3] The first student was easily distracted, whereas the other was focused and diligent in studying weiqi. Consequently, the former found no success whereas the latter excelled in the game. Mencius used this tale to expound that even a simple game like Weiqi demands one's full attention.[4] This is also the earliest known historical reference to weiqi, making Yi Qiu the first recorded weiqi player in history.[5][6][7]” Wikipedia Yi Qiu

Addiction to Weiqi was considered by the Chinese philosopher Mencius (372-289BC) one of the five types of unfilial behavior.” HuffPo

Originally I thought the Knight’s Move (As referenced in Hikaru No Go and NHK Go tournament videos on Youtube) was named after the knight in European chess but Xiangqi also has the same knight’s move.

I doubted the gender skill divide so I watched a match between the female Hon’inbo and a 7 dan male player and the female Honinbo actually lost.
This may be because according to the first chapter of the Treasure Chest Enigma, by Peter Shotwell, “women have busier lives than men so do not have as much time to spend on such puzzles.”

Lee Se-dol went on to win a tournament after losing to AlphaGo (source: AlphaGo documentary) but later on retired and scheduled to play against another program with a 2 stone handicap. “Even if I become number one...” (source: duckduckgo search). However [spoiler], retiring does not necessarily mean quitting, as Hikaru no Go explains.

“In Asia, there is not as much stigma like there is in the West for becoming an expert/genius at the expense of letting the physical body deteriorate, like we see in The Theory of Everything.”



“Early writings depicted Weiqi as a waste of time, but eventually became included in the four noble things of gentry.”

“I remember the chill of the Go stones” -Fujiwara-no-Sai in Hikaru no Go. Go stones are indeed a little chilly. Boards are indeed made of wood. Placing stones on the intersections of the trenched lines probably makes them less likely to move around.

Go stones can literally be stones or bottle-caps (Hikaru No Go’s Go Go Igo live action videos) (or expensively made from large white seashells (source: Chinese weiqi documentary series of Go even in jail and also in religion)). A kifu is a record of a game on paper (Hikaru No Go). With these things in mind, Go can be played with just paper sheets and a pen. Although Go is “a very hard game” (librarian), there are less physical limitations and rules to learn than chess.

Expensive quality Go boards are made with kaya wood which is light colored and produces a sharp clack when a stone is placed. Fake kaya called shin-kaya is often made from imported spruce to Japan and has the same color but lacks the sound. There is also another type of wood for boards. (Hikaru no Go).

The Japanese Robotics Innovations speaker who was a robotics patent decider particularly for toy robots and also video games, told me about the relation of AI to the game of shogi.

My favorite part of the talk was how he explained the need for robotics due to Japan’s aging population.

Hon’inbo Shusaku (surname) Torajiro (given name) died early in his 30s due to an epidemic. Shusaku invented Shusaku’s Diagonal, “a series of opening moves that remains popular in games without komi” (Go Go Igo).

There is also an app game called BadukPop which has powerups (Haylee’s World of Go).

Hikaru no Go has an episode “No winning allowed” in which the challenge is to play to a perfect draw without the opponent realizing what the pro is doing. 

(Rated  TV-MA) “Misaeng” episode 1,3 on Netflix, a Korean series about a failed Go/baduk prodigy. But I only found it by searching for 囲碁　in Japanese. Episode 1 shows the pronunciation of Baduk/Paduk 바둑.

Sanitation in Go is important because in Go Salons, the stones need to be washed (Source, Hikaru no Go). Perhaps a reason that wooden Go boards have prevailed over plastic (besides in magnetic Go boards, probably) is because wooden cutting boards are supposedly more antibacterial than plastic cutting boards (source: https://www.rowandsons.co.uk/blog/myth-fact-antibacterial-properties-wood/ although this site sells wooden and plastic cutting boards, it references this article: https://www.johnboos.com/uploads/files/PDF/wood-vs-plastic-cutting-boards.pdf although this site also sells wooden cutting boards. Also, water in wooden cups or plastic bottles with bamboo chopsticks smells less stale than water in ceramic cups (without chopsticks) or plastic bottles without chopsticks).

Answer 2


Weiqi is often compared to war or the creation of starry galaxies (Hikaru no Go, Ernest Brown's The Glass Bead Game), but weiqi seems more like white blood cells consuming their enemies. The ease in which AlphaGo transitioned to folding proteins shows how realistic weiqi looks, especially on a molecular or cellular scale.

The art of resigning (The Treasure Chest Enigma book) could be used not only with human vs. AI matches but also during AI training with itself, as it may speed up the process (with the expense of reduced meticulousness). The Art of Resigning chapter says the main difference between pros and amateurs is that pros resign more often. This may be because pros are more able to see a match's fate (Sai in Hikaru-no-go) and also because resigning helps give players more training time to become pros. It is not quite clear from papers and README documentations as to whether AIs already implement resignation for training with itself. Looking at the code might be necessary. However, it is difficult even to simply program the rules of Go because capturing involves analyzing many links between stones. Quality Go game emulators are sometimes only commented with Chinese. A way to test the effectiveness of resigning could be to give at least 4 virtual players the same amount of time to play multiple games, with 2 players playing to resign and the other 2 players playing out the entire games without resigning.

A way to make Go more appealng to women might be to label it more like Candy Crush and focus more on the eating aspect of the game rather than the surrounding part.

Terms for move spacings in Go like the knight's move and the elephant's eye (hazama) probably come from Xiangqi (象棋, the Elephant Game, Chinese Chess) even though Go/Weiqi came first.
