It just so happens we live next to an archery field, but he does not even want to play the Weiqi game he has on Christmas even though in Spring 2019 he askeed me to teach him. But I did beat him in Super Smash Bros. despite being more out of practice then a girl in ACV.

Confucius answered a question saying a state needs confidence more than food, and food more than military. Out of the 3, military should be disposed of first if one had to choose.

Han Fei (a Legalist inspired by Confucianism) said his teacher said men are inherently selfish and cannot be restricted without law (法, fǎ). Source: QM 9 Songs.
Wikipedia said although Han Fei incorporated Confucianism he still used "rule of law" and thus Confucius' vision of a rule without law was never reached. but Prof. Menkus' class said Confucius wanted to restore the Tang Dynasty, so there was probably rule without law at some point. By rule without law, that probably means a ruler without rules, only ritual guidelines.
The TA in Prof. Menkus' class also advised for me that I rewrite my Human Rights essay on the one Asian film we learned about. That was probably helpful in the long run.
Praise be to Ganesha god of education that I had downloaded all the course files before the Global Human Rights class Canvas page went offline.


In the live action (L.A.) Untamed MDZS, the donkey  Apple (小苹果） kicked the dog Fairy for biting him.
In the old spinoff movie Qin's Moon: Something Robot, there was a Qin general named General Fruit, and at first he was a villain but later he saved lives. Fruit as in 水果. Needless to say he was good at Fruit Ninja.
The word ninja is relatively recent and has a more brutal meaning than shinobi. source: the last ninja explaining Naruto.
I have not written anything formal in Japanese I will try writing "mushin no shin".

I have not slept all day since 24 hours ago when I woke up to try to be a relational person like Kongzi.
