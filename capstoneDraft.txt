The board game Go, or Igo in Japanese, Weiqi (wei as in å›´=border, enclose), and Baduk in Korean, is a better game than English chess because you require a brain of intuition to play it and you cannot simply "use the "brute force" algorithm of going through every permutation and possibility to get the most points, because there are more permutations in Chinese "chess" so to speak and because the tides can be turned all of a sudden, similar to the game Othello, also called Reversi, and in the animated Qin's Moon series, Othello is called Mohist chess. Ammassing an army can lead to your own downfall. The Art of War by Sunzi also said (although it contradicted itself as well a littlee) to leave a gap open for the enemy to retreat (instead of seiging a city on all sides like how Qin mistakenly attempted on the city of Zhao) to minimize causualties on both sided.
The Art of War also said not to give up pursuit or to not act while the enemy stalls in place. However, that latter quote is echoed by the Chu state, which was even more militaristic than Qin. Mojia, the Mohist clan, only condoned fighting and seige engines for self defense of a city, not offense.
