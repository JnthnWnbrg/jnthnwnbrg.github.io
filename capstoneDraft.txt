I ought to buy an electric blanket from Alibaba because the high powered Alternating Current electric blankets on Amazon all have an auto-shutoff feature. Mreanwhile Korean fans (electric fans not Kpop fans) have an auto shutoff feature.
Google Docs is also imperfect because when I edit the document the cursor does not start out at the end of the file. So now I am being Mohist again and using a computer code editor instead. From my CS minor and my Asian Studies major alone, the philosophy I seem closest too would be Mohism. But taking into account my veganism, I might be closer to Daoism (the inventors of tofu) or Buddhism (which was not always as vegetarian as it is now). I had even started out at USF wanting to major in Performance Art although I enrolled in Computer Science following my dad's order and advice. I learned some things about Asia in Dance classes such as the Japanese slow Butoh dance performed locally at Nohspace. Even perhaps Hip Hop could be related to Asia because most of the class were Chinese nationals, and the professor was Matthew Montenegro, who I later re-encountered in the Barrio Fiesta class. The professor of the Software Development class I dropped out of (not the first one) was Matthew Malensek, who later appeared at the 2019 Diwali Festival.
     I think anime is not just a waste of time. Actually, I did not even spend enough time on it because I did not know how to pronounce it until Prof. Roddy's Tale of Genji class. The last ninja in real life explained how the Naruto run prevents tripping. If I had not been so afraid to act like my nerdy peer in elementary school doing the similar Lucario run, I would not have tripped and broken my tooth, which gave me pain even ten years later at USF. The way they fixed my tooth also did not account for my natural space behind my teeth which have something like talon cusps, which Native Americans have. I only have 1 percent DNA from East Asia or Native America but I suppose it may be enough to explain why numerous dentists overlook the reason why my teeth have become crooked after the fix. As the film "Code: Debugging the Gender Gap" hosted by Alark Joshi said, when engineers neglected to test dummies of underrepresented people such as women and kids, the airbags killed them. I think the same might be true for underrepresented racial minorities as well. When I bought a facemask for the first wildfire, it did not fit even though it fit my friend Eric Fu. I read online that facemasks are often designed for Caucasians but do not fit their target demographic in Asia. In my case, the opposite was probably true. If I am privileged enough to have a career in Asian Studies, or even if I continue my tech internship, or just in daily life, I will need to take into account people's racial and ethnic differences and needs. As Coach Merino said, "realizing that not everyone is the same as you and respecting that."
